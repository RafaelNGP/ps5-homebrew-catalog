"""Find newer upstream releases and turn them into updated records.

For a listed release, the newest published release of its repository
(pre-releases included) becomes the proposed update when:

- it has an asset with the same file type that is unambiguously the successor
  of the listed one (same name, or the same name with the version changed, or
  the only asset of that type);
- GitHub reports a SHA-256 digest for that asset (nothing is downloaded).

The version follows the tag in the record's existing style, and a tag-pinned
icon_url is moved to the new tag when the icon exists there. Everything else in
the record stays unchanged.
